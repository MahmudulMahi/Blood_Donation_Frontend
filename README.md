# Blood Donation Frontend

1. Donor Registration: Donors can sign up on the platform by providing their personal information, including name, contact details, blood type, and any relevant medical history. They can also specify their willingness to be regular donors.
2. Search and Schedule Donations: Donors can search for upcoming blood donation events or schedule appointments at donation centers. They receive notifications and reminders about their scheduled donations.
3. Blood Bank Management: Blood banks can manage their inventory of blood units, including tracking the quantity, type, and expiration dates of available blood supplies. They can also update inventory status in real-time.
4. Recipient Requests: Hospitals and medical facilities can submit requests for specific blood types or quantities. These requests are broadcasted to eligible donors and blood banks in the vicinity, ensuring timely responses.
5. Emergency Response: In case of emergencies or shortages, the system can send out alerts to registered donors and blood banks, encouraging immediate donations or mobilization of resources.
6. Communication and Feedback: The platform facilitates communication between donors, recipients, and blood banks through messaging features. Donors can also provide feedback on their donation experiences, helping to improve the system's efficiency.
